# PrePluginFundaments

This is an utility project, NOT PLUGIN!

His utility is reducing a lot the time spent setting up the bases of a plugin, by simply copying
and pasting the classes you can see in the src, then start working on your real plugin, without
needing to type yourself the classes for data manager, configs and cmds.
